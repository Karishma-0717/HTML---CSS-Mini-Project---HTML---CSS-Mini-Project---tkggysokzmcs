        <h2>Napier bridge</h2>
        <p>Built by British to bridge the River Cooum and connect Fort St. George to the Marina in 1869, it is named after a Governor of Madras, Francis Napier. The People of Chennai call it "Irumbu Varavadhi" which translate into "Iron Bridge". The bridge was essential for the British to cross the river and develop the City of Chennai by adding Chepuk, Triplicane, Mylapore etc., and to allow the people to move towards the Fort and George Town.

            The bridge has 6 Numbers Bowstring Spans covering about 140metres\. Now there are two parallel structures having 3 lanes each and the western one was added in 1999 to ease the traffic .
            
            The bridge is visible from Air when the plane approaches from the seaside (North East) and looks beautiful at night when it is fully lit</p>
